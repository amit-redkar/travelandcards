Most people don’t know this:
If you transfer your HDFC points directly to Qatar Airways or British Airways using SmartBuy, you get a 2:1 ratio (that means 1 HDFC point = only 0.5 Avios).
You instantly lose half your value.

But in this video, I’m showing you the hidden 1:1 transfer trick that experienced travel hackers and aviation geeks use to get 100% more value from their HDFC Infinia / Diners Black points.

✨ What This Video Covers 

In this complete step-by-step tutorial, you will learn:

✔ How to transfer HDFC Infinia & HDFC Diners Club Black points to Finnair Plus at 1:1
✔ How Finnair uses Avios, the same currency used by Qatar Airways & British Airways
✔ How to link your Avios accounts (Finnair ↔ Qatar ↔ BA)
✔ How to move Avios instantly at 1:1 from Finnair → Qatar Airways Privilege Club
✔ How to move Avios instantly at 1:1 from Finnair → British Airways Executive Club
✔ Why this trick gives you twice the value compared to direct HDFC transfers
✔ When you should use Qatar Privilege Club vs British Airways Executive Club
✔ Real examples of how many miles you save using this trick
✔ Whether KrisFlyer is still worth it in 2025
✔ Updated HDFC transfer ratios and partner list
✔ Why HDFC Infinia & Diners Black are still the #1 cards in India for travel

This guide is perfect for anyone using HDFC Infinia, HDFC Diners Club Black, HDFC Diners Black Metal, and even other HDFC premium cards that allow airline miles transfer.

💡 Why This Hack Works 

HDFC Bank has a 1:1 transfer partnership with Finnair Plus.
Finnair recently migrated to Avios, the same points system as:

• Qatar Airways Privilege Club
• British Airways Executive Club
• Iberia Plus
• Aer Lingus AerClub
• Vueling Club

This means all these programs use one unified wallet.
So once your HDFC points become Finnair Avios at 1:1, you can shift them to any Avios airline at full value.

This hack is especially powerful for:

✈ Business Class redemptions
✈ Middle East flights on Qatar Airways
✈ Europe & US flights on British Airways
✈ Oneworld partner bookings
✈ Ultra low taxes/fees award routes

If you're planning trips to Doha, London, Europe, USA, Japan, Singapore, Australia, or anywhere serviced by Oneworld, this method can save you tens of thousands of Avios.
