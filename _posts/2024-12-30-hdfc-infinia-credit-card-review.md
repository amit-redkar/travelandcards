The HDFC Infinia is considered one of the best premium credit cards in India. In this video, I break down everything you need to know.

## Key Benefits

The card offers 5X reward points on all spends, which translates to roughly 3.3% return. You also get unlimited airport lounge access worldwide with Priority Pass.

## Who Should Get This Card?

If you spend over ₹8-10 lakhs annually and travel frequently, the Infinia makes sense. The annual fee is ₹12,500 but easily recoverable through benefits.

## Final Verdict

For premium travelers and high spenders, this is the gold standard in Indian credit cards. Watch the full video above for my detailed breakdown including the application process.
