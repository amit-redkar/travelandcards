In this video, I break down every major benefit of the HSBC Premier Account and HSBC Premier Credit Card in India — including exclusive travel perks, airport privileges, reward point hacks, Accor conversions, and hidden benefits most people don’t know about.




If you travel even a few times a year, HSBC Premier is one of the most powerful premium banking programs in India, and in this video I show you why.




I also reveal my real-world Accor points strategy where a ₹1 lakh hotel booking can give back up to ₹1.08 lakh in value, using HSBC Premier reward points, Accor 1:1 conversion, and bonus transfer windows. I even log in and show the Accor points credit live on screen.




This is not a sponsored video — it’s a full breakdown based on real usage.
